You can get some entry-level jobs in high school, and higher-paying jobs have higher requirements. Your application won't be accepted if you don't meet the requirements.<br><br>Every time you age up, you acquire 30% of your salary, as you spent 70% on food, water, shelter, and other general expenses. If you have additional expenses they will also be tacked from your salary.
